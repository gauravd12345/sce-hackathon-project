# GitMap


## AI-powered GitHub repository discovery.
GitMap helps you find the right GitHub repositories with ease. It takes your natural language queries and uses Gemini API to generate smart, relevant keywords. With those keywords, it returns a curated list of repositories that best match your needs. Here is a demonstration: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhj_f6csgkU
